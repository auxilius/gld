# OpenGL Visualization Library (GLV)
GLV is a library for the visualization of OpenGL textures, models or other resources. The library is adding a possibility for users to open additional window beside their program, which can be then used for displaying a model in multiple ways, textures or variable values.

The User can configure window layout, to decide what to displayinthewindow. The library also supports creating more layouts and switching between them at runtime. User is free to apply his own shaders and vertex attributes for in-
dividual objects, to customize visualization. Library can be used as a supportive visualizer or tool for debugging
OpenGL applications.
